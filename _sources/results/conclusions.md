The use of HPC solutions allowed calibrating GEOtop within a reasonable time and exploring properly the parameters space. The code developed, which is published and freely available on GitHub, also shows how libraries and tools used within the machine learning community could be useful and easily adapted to Earth-system and environmental models calibration.

## The Beautiful Uselessness of Computer Science

The main problem of present scientific research is the adoption of the ideas and methods from free market. Research institutes must profit from the work of researchers and profit is measured in publications and funding. The phenomenon is not something new, but the degree to which it permeated academia is unedited. Also, it is tightly linked to the sociopolitical and economic system in which we live, and probably irreversible. From the point of view of the quality of research, the worst effect is the creation the positive feedback loops on some research topics and the stagnation of others. We live in a time of a profound, yet silent, crisis in science.

Of course, technology and applied science, which have an immediate return, are more likely to be funded and hence get more attention from researchers. In some cases, the situation is exacerbated by lack of scientific rigour. Prominent examples of speculative bubbles are HPC and some topics in machine learning, as artificial neural networks for example.

Many publications regarding these tools are about technological advances, of varying interest and value. These tools are not completely useless for any scientific endeavour, but neither the answer to every possible problem. On the contrary, the application of some methods from machine learning, as artificial neural networks, is the utmost failure of reductionism. The use of mathematical language, scientific method, and reductionism fueled the most spectacular achievements in our understanding of nature: all of them are in danger.

Some problems in modern science requires HPC, although fewer than promised by exascale evangelists. Nonetheless, is it HPC an interesting scientific topic per se? I think that the answer is yes. Understanding the performance of large distributed systems, running thousands of coordinated processes, is an interesting subject. However, the paradigm shift is in the understanding of something for the sake of it, out of curiosity. Paradoxically, it is from gratuitous knowledge that the greatest advances come out, in the long run.

More generally, a similar situation exists in computer science (which according to Hal Abelson is not a science and is not about computers). Its cultural relevance and brief history rich of beautiful ideas are not recognized, and it is poorly taught. As long as we see it as a screwdriver, or a hammer, we are doomed to reinvent poorly the wheel. Only when we will see its beautiful uselessness we will make real progress.
