# Brief Introduction to GEOtop

```{epigraph}
When a program grows in power by an evolution of partially‑understood patches and fixes, the programmer begins to lose track of internal details and can no longer predict what will happen—and begins to hope instead of know, watching the program as though it were an individual of unpredictable behavior.

--Marvin Minsky, _Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly understood and sloppily formulated ideas_
