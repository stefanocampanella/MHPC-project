# Conclusions

The use of HPC solutions allowed calibrating GEOtop within a reasonable time and with acceptable results, notwithstanding the large parameters space. The code developed, which is published and freely available on GitHub, also shows how libraries and tools used within the machine learning community could be useful and easily adapted to Earth-system and environmental models calibration. Finally, a simple performance model for the computation has been discussed.

Some examples of further research topics are:

* empirical studies on the choice of optimization algorithms and hyperparameters,
* determination of the optimal population size,  
* use of local optimization algorithms for refinement of the solutions, and
* interpretation and validation of the solutions.
