# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Giacomo Bertoldi, for giving me this opportunity, Alberto Sartori for his help during the whole master, Ing. Piero Calucci for his assistance, Stefano Salon for his advice, and Alessandro Vuan for his patience.

I would also like to thank Nuno Carvalhais for the conversations we had and all the good ideas he gave me (all the bad ones are mine of course).

Finally, I would like to thank Fulvio and Erica for being my psychonautics guides and fellows in this strange, difficult, transformative year, Cosimo for his tenacious encouragement and Giorgio, aka "Il Sommo", whose discreet example and savvy words have so much influence on me; to him goes the merit (or demerit, the future will tell) of suggesting me to apply for the MHPC.
